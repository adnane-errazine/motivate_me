IMPORTANT: Only extract major concepts, theorems, phenomena, and advanced mathematical/scientific principles. 
DO NOT extract basic elements like:
- Individual numbers, variables, or symbols
- Basic operations (+, -, ร, รท)
- Simple geometric shapes
- Elementary concepts

DO extract significant concepts like:
- Named theorems (Fourier Transform, Laplace Transform, etc.)
- Mathematical phenomena (Resonance, Interference, etc.)  
- Advanced techniques (Convolution, Optimization, etc.)
- Scientific principles (Wave mechanics, Quantum effects, etc.)
- Engineering methods (Signal processing, Control theory, etc.)

For each significant concept, provide:
1. Name: The official name of the theorem/concept/phenomenon
2. Type: (theorem, principle, method, phenomenon, etc.)
3. Domain: (mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, etc.)
4. Significance: Why this concept is important and powerful
5. Mathematical_basis: Core mathematical foundation
6. Confidence: Your confidence this is correctly identified (0.0-1.0)

Return a JSON array with only the most significant 2-4 concepts. Quality over quantity."""
